# Mars-X Skylanders Smart Contract

## Overview

The **MarsxLands** smart [contract](https://amoy.polygonscan.com/address/0x180D6367f2888F8b2aDe7623362022F2Ed98639c#code) is an ERC721-based contract designed to manage the minting and sale of digital lands using the ERC20 MX token. Each community in the platform can have a maximum of 100,000 lands, and users can buy these lands by providing a valid signature and paying the mint price in MX tokens. The contract also implements various features for ownership control, security, and flexibility in setting prices and managing token metadata.

## Features

- **Minting Lands**: Allows users to mint lands for specific communities by paying with the MX token.
- **Signature Verification**: Ensures that only authorized transactions can proceed using ECDSA signature validation.
- **Non-reentrancy Protection**:  Uses `ReentrancyGuard` to prevent reentrancy attacks.
- **Dynamic Price Setting**: Owners can update the mint price of lands.
- **Token Metadata Management:**: Supports the retrieval and update of metadata URIs.
- **MX Token Withdrawals**: Owners can withdraw accumulated MX tokens from the contract.
- **Nonce Management**: Tracks nonces for secure and unique transaction validation.
- **Community-Based Minting**: Each community has 100,000 land NFTs available for minting.

## Contract Details

- **Name**: MarsX-Skylanders
- **Symbol**: MXL
- **Token Standards**: ERC721
- **Supported Tokens**:
  - MX: 18 decimals
- **Dependencies**:
  - OpenZeppelin Contracts (`ERC721`, `Ownable`, `ReentrancyGuard`)

## Constructor

```solidity
constructor(
 address _mxTokenAddress, // Address of the deployed MX ERC20 token.
 address _authorizedSigner, // The address allowed to sign minting transactions.
 uint256 _mintPrice, // Initial mint price for each land in MX tokens.
 string memory baseURI, // The base URI for metadata (e.g., `https://metadata.marsx.com/`).
)
```


## Contract Variables

- **`IERC20 public mxToken`**  
  The instance of the ERC20 token contract used for transactions within the `MarsxLands` contract. This variable allows the contract to interact with the MX token.

- **`mapping(uint256 => bool) private _mintedTokens`**  
  A mapping that tracks whether a specific token ID has been minted. The key is the token ID, and the value is a boolean indicating if it has been minted (`true`) or not (`false`).

- **`uint256 public mintPrice`**  
  The price to mint a single land in MX tokens, represented with 18 decimal places.

- **`uint256 public maxLandPerCommunity`**  
  The maximum number of lands that can be minted for a single community, set to `1000000` by default.

- **`mapping(uint256 => uint256) public communityLandCount`**  
  A mapping that tracks the number of lands minted for each community. The key is the community ID, and the value is the count of minted lands for that community.

- **`address private authorizedSigner`**  
  The address of the authorized signer that can create valid signatures for minting transactions. This ensures that only authorized users can confirm minting requests.

- **`mapping(address => uint256) public nonces`**  
  A mapping that keeps track of the nonce for each user. This is used to prevent replay attacks by ensuring that each transaction has a unique nonce.

- **`string private _baseTokenURI`**  
  The base URI for all token metadata, which can be updated by the contract owner. This is used to construct the full URI for each token's metadata.


### Events

- **`event LandMinted(address indexed buyer, uint256 communityId, uint256 tokenId)`**  
  Emitted when a land is successfully minted. This event provides the following information:
  - **`buyer`**: The address of the buyer who purchased the land.
  - **`communityId`**: The ID of the community to which the minted land belongs.
  - **`tokenId`**: The unique identifier for the minted land.

- **`event AuthorizedSignerUpdated(address indexed oldSigner, address indexed newSigner)`**  
  Emitted when the authorized signer is updated. This event indicates changes to the signerâ€™s address:
  - **`oldSigner`**: The previous address of the authorized signer.
  - **`newSigner`**: The new address of the authorized signer.

- **`event BaseTokenURIUpdated(string oldURI, string newURI)`**  
  Emitted when the base token URI is updated. This event captures the change in the base URI used for token metadata:
  - **`oldURI`**: The previous base URI before the update.
  - **`newURI`**: The new base URI that will be used moving forward.

- **`event SetPrice(uint256 oldPrice, uint256 newPrice)`**  
  Emitted when the mint price is changed. This event records the update in the cost of minting:
  - **`oldPrice`**: The previous price (in MX tokens) before the change.
  - **`newPrice`**: The updated price (in MX tokens) for minting a land.




## Functions

### `buyLand(uint256 communityId, uint256[] calldata tokenIds, uint256 nonce, bytes calldata signature)`
Allows users to mint multiple lands for a community by paying with MX tokens. 

**Parameters**:
- `communityId` (uint256): The ID of the community for which the lands are being minted.
- `tokenIds` (uint256[]): An array of token IDs to be minted.
- `nonce` (uint256): A unique nonce for the buyer's address, used to prevent replay attacks.
- `signature` (bytes): A valid ECDSA signature from the authorized signer to confirm the transaction.

**Reverts**:
- If the signature is invalid.
- If the nonce does not match the expected value for the user.
- If the number of token IDs exceeds the maximum allowed for the community.
- If the total MX token transfer fails.
- If any of the token IDs have already been minted.

**Events Emitted**:
- `LandMinted(address indexed buyer, uint256 communityId, uint256 tokenId)`: Emitted for each successful minting of land.

---

Overrides the default base URI function for the ERC721 standard.

**Returns**:

---

### `tokenURI(uint256 tokenId) public view virtual override returns (string memory)`
Returns the full token URI for a specific token ID, including the token ID and the `.json` suffix for metadata.

**Parameters**:
- `tokenId` (uint256): The ID of the token for which to retrieve the URI.

**Returns**:
- `string`: The complete token URI for the specified token ID.



## Security Considerations

### Reentrancy
- The `buyLand` function is protected by the `nonReentrant` modifier, preventing reentrant calls and ensuring that funds cannot be manipulated during a token transfer.

### Signature Verification
- The contract verifies the signature using ECDSA to ensure that only authorized requests can mint lands. Invalid signatures will revert the transaction, maintaining the integrity of the minting process.

### Nonce Management
- Nonces are used to prevent replay attacks. Each time a user mints lands, their nonce is incremented, ensuring that each signature can only be used once.


### Input Validation
- The contract checks various conditions before minting lands:
  - Ensures that the user is minting at least one token.
  - Validates that the total minted lands do not exceed the maximum supply for the community.
  - Confirms that the specified token IDs have not been previously minted.
